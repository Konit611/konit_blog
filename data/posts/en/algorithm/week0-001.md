## Tips

Review others' problem solutions

Keep records (understand how far you could solve, why you couldn't solve it if you couldn't, and identify where you got stuck)

Solve problems with a set time limit, like taking an exam

Summarize in your own words.

## Practice Problem Analysis

### 1. Break down and analyze the problem.

Break it down into the smallest possible parts → This connects to writing the problem-solving sequence.

### 2. Identify constraints and add test cases.

Add test cases to verify proper handling of constraints (time, boundary values, maximum values, minimum values, etc.).

### 3. Analyze input size → Consider time complexity while writing algorithms.

Consider algorithms based on the given data size and time constraints.

### 4. Identify key keywords → Improves problem interpretation skills.

There are key keywords, but it's not always "if this word appears, then this algorithm must be used!"

### 5. Understand data flow and structure → Determine which data structures to use.

Pre-analyze aspects like whether data input/output is frequent, if there are cases of inserting data at index 0, etc.

## Practice Designing with Pseudocode

### 1. Focus on operations rather than detailed implementation.

No need to consider data types or sizes.

### 2. Write in problem-solving order.

### 3. Verify test case passage at the pseudocode stage.

It's important to verify at the design stage whether various test cases meeting the constraints pass.
