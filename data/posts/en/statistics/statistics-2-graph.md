Methods for representing data in graphs

## Stem-and-Leaf Plot

A method of separating tens and units digits for representation

## Histogram

Setting intervals on the horizontal axis, showing how many numbers are in each class (frequency)
A frequency distribution chart showing how frequencies are distributed across data classes

## Scatter Plot

A graph that can simultaneously represent two variables
Can also show histograms together

### Scatter Plot and Correlation Coefficient

It's difficult to see the exact correlation coefficient, but trends can be observed.
 - When points are scattered, it's close to 0

### Scatter Plot and Linear Transformation

What about the histogram of sums? → Large variance
What about the histogram of differences? → Small variance

A positive correlation coefficient means that people with high math scores tend to have high math scores

## Box Plot

The line in the center of the box is the median (not the mean) → 12th data point
The lines at both ends of the box are the first quartile on the smaller side and the third quartile on the larger side.
	Box length → becomes the interquartile range
The whisker parts have dotted lines extending to the minimum and maximum values, with cutoff lines.
(However, whiskers can only extend up to 1.5 times the interquartile range from both ends of the box → values outside this range are considered "outliers".)

## Scoring Points

### Average Rate of Change

Time series data: data with a time axis, represented by line graphs
About average rate of change
What is rate of change?
The reference value before change,
Rate of change = amount of change / reference value

What about the rate of change per year, not over 3 years?
The elapsed time needs to be considered.

Finding r when 1200 x (1+r)^n = 1278.

(1+r)^3 = rate of change
r = (rate of change)^(1/3) - 1

Since calculating to the power of 1/3 is difficult, the calculation formula itself is likely to appear.
For percentages, you need to multiply by 100.

### Laspeyres Price Index

A price index that shows how prices in 2024 compare to 2020 from the table
Since the rate of increase differs by item, it's necessary to calculate prices comprehensively.

Since we want to see what is used more, quantity data is also needed
If the base year is not changed, it can be used for subsequent years as well

### Lorenz Curve and Gini Coefficient

Represents income disparity by population proportion of a certain group.
The Gini coefficient is twice the area; the larger the Gini coefficient, the greater the disparity

### Correlogram

Autocorrelation coefficient of time series data, moving time points
For data with periodicity, it becomes wave-like data.
